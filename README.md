# My unix home rc's files

Configurations/plugins for some unix programs that I use every day.

- GNU screen
- vim
- bash
- X11

## Vim 

For vim there is a script to maintain/update plugins and configurations at `vim/update.sh`. It will backup your current configuration in `$HOME/.vim.backup` before to make any change.

Included plugins:

- Pathogen https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen - *Plugin / Runtime manager for vim.*
- NERDTree https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree - *A tree explorer for vim.*
- CtrlP https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim - *Open files with CTRL+P*
- Syntastic https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic - *Syntax checker*
- Vim Airline https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline - *Status/tabline for vim that's light as air*
