# Dotfiles

> This repository contains my dotfiles for Unix (ATM only macOS and GNU/Linux).

## Requirements

The program [GNU/Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is used to synchronise the local files with the home folder. 

Also, `GNU make` is an optional dependency just for convenience.

```sh
# Install stow in Debian
sudo apt install stow

# Install stow in macOS with home-brew
brew install stow
```
