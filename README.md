### My unix home rc's files

# Automated configuration for "vanilla" linux installations:

- vim
- bash
- envars
- X11 tweaks

# Usage

```bash
# The only requirement
apt install git

# Clone this repo
clone https://github.com/shaggyz/home-scripts.git

# Move to bin directory
cd home-scripts/bin

# Run the installation script (always inside bin/)
./home-scripts
```
