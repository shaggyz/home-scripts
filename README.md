# My unix home rc's files

Configurations/plugins for some unix programs that I use every day.

- GNU screen
- vim
- bash
- X11

## Vim 

For vim, there is a script to maintain/update plugins and configurations at `vim/update.sh`. It will backup your current configuration in `$HOME/.vim.backup` before to make any change.
